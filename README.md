## Project Requirements
- Use React for the front end.
- Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
- Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
- Have a polished UI.
- Be responsive. 
- Be interactive (i.e. accept and respond to user input).
- Include authentication (JWT). 
- Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, and so on).
- Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## CSS Styling
Consider the following suggestions in lieu of using a CSS library:
- Explore the concept of CSS-in-JS, which abstracts CSS to the component level, using JavaScript to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way. Some popular libraries include [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).
- Try using a component library, such as [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), or [Ant Design](https://ant.design/).
- Create all the CSS for your application just using CSS.

## Payment Platform
- Consider integrating the Stripe payment platform. Even if you don't create an e-commerce application, you could set up your site to accept charitable donations.

## Bonus
Not a requirement, but try to also implement functionality to meet the minimum requirements of a PWA:
- Uses a web manifest.
- Uses a service worker for offline functionality.
- Is installable.

## Presentation Requirements
- Elevator pitch: A one-minute description of your application.
- Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
- Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
- Demo: Show your stuff!
- Directions for future development.
- Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository. Use the Guide to Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas on the Full-Stack BlogLinks to an external site. if you need a reminder on how to deploy to Heroku.
