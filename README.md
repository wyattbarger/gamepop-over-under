### DESCRIPTION


This application is a game where users have the ability to create an account that they can log into, and tack highscores with, which is based around guessing whether a video game is more or less popular than the game presented in the card to its left, which has its rating visible to the user. The game continues as long as the user continues to guess correctly, and ends as soon as the user gives the wrong answer, at which point they are brought to a game over screen prompting them to head to the home page, or paly again.
